#Microglia Analysis tool V1.0#

This README should act as a road map for how to train the automated pipeline.

If you do not wish to train the pipeline, but simply to execute it, skip to the "RUNNING THE PIPELINE" section below.

NOTE: This should not be used literally line-by-line, as further care needs to be taken. Please additionally read the documentation for each file being run.

## Execution Environment + Dependencies ##

Requires at least MATLAB R2017b

Also requires the following addons within MATLAB:
-"Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox"
-"Neural Network Toolbox"
-"Image Processing Toolbox" 

## WHITE MATTER SEGMENTATION DETECTION

The White Matter Segmentation system is integrated into the full pipeline in this repository. There are remnants in the code of how it behaved as an independent system. 

1. open the script "+ROI/private/Run.m"

2. change the variable "TRAIN_PATH" to the directory containing training slides
   Note: if this is being performed out of the pipeline, the "TEST_PATH" and
   "RESULTS_PATH" variables also need to be added accordingly

3. change the variable "processSlides" to "true" if this is the first time training (This should be set to false if the slides have already been processed and have associated .mat files).

4. same steps as number 3 but now for the test slides

5. Change the status of "isTesting", "isTrained", and "isInterfacing" variables accordingly
    -isTrained---> Trains the classifier using the training data
    -isTesting---> Uses the classifier to perform segmentation on testing data
    -isInterfacing---> generates patch-wise output for microglia detection (required for the rest of the pipeline).

6. final step is to change the type of the image files in the scripts "RunTimeInfo.m",
    "brain_slide_process.m", and "brain_slide_process_test.m" according to the type of
    images that are being used (TIF vs SVS) for training and testing separately

7. Run "Run.m" and white matter segmentation should begin

Typical scenario is that the training slides have already been processed,
therefore the above variables would normally be set as:

processSlides = false;
processTestSlides = true;
isTesting = true;
isTrained = false;
isInterfacing = true;

NOTE: The integrated WM segmentation step in the pipeline is built so that a model is retrained every time on a static data set since it is very quick to do so. To change this stati 

## CELL DETECTION ANALYSIS TRAINING

1. run init.m
-resets the configuration parameters, and sets path info.

2. Execute White Matter segmentation (above)
-result is a collection of folders for each slide

3. Sample the White Matter patches to get a smaller collection
execute Tools.interface_output_sampler

4. Take sampled WM patches (1.tif to N.tif), put them in the +Annotation_cell/cell_detection_analysis_utility/images folder

5. Label microglia positions by running the following until it says you are done:
execute Annotation_cell.manual_label_new_image

    Optionally perform a second labelling
    -rename +Annotation_cell/cell_detection_analysis_utility/labelling/annotation_data.mat to annotation_data_[NAME].mat
    -execute Annotation_cell.combine_data

6. Check if annotation worked properly
execute Annotation_cell.display_truth('labeller1'); or labeller1/labeller2/union/intersect

7. Split WM patches into train / test
execute Tools.train_test_sampler; %be careful to change the parameters in the file

8. Perform gradient descent to optimize segmentation parameters
execute Tools.GradDescent.learn('intersect','algorithm','train');
-Possibly need to rerun after finishing with a lower learning rate, to optimize even better.

9. Insert the results of the gradient descent into the configuration file
-Go to Config.get_config, and fix the values of LOWER_SIZE_BOUND and MUMFORD_SHAH_LAMBDA
-run init.m  %to update the config values

10. Make cell sets for CNN training
execute ML.prepare_training('union', 1.0); %union/labeller1/labeller2/intersect
-do less than 1.0 if you want to report results on a validation set

11. Make classification model. Open the location saved in (11)
execute ML.NN.output_classifier;

12. Update cell classifier path in Config.get_config based on saved classifier in (12)
-also confirm 'USE_DEEP_FILTER' is set to 1 in Config.get_config;
-run init.m  %to update the config values

13. test model a few times for fun, and to make sure things are kind of working
execute Verify.evaluate_single_random;

14. Run a full set analysis:
execute Verify.evaluate_all('union', 'algorithm', 'validate') %labeller1/labeller2/union/intersect/algorithm, train/test/validate

15. Run and view full Precision-recall curve
execute Verify.save_PR_results('test'); %test/train but probably you want 'test'
execute Verify.view_PR_results; %prompts a dialogue to open the previous

## MORPHOLOGY ANALYSIS TRAINING

16. Get cell set for training data
execute Annotation_morph.output_cells %saves a collection of cells
execute Annotation_morph.sample_images %samples cells from the above generated collection

17. Put these sampled images into +Annotation_morph/morphology_annotation_utility/images

18. Label cell data
execute +Annotation_morph/morphology_annotation_utility/manual_label_new_image.m
-do until you are told you are finished

19. Evaluate how good classification is with an SVM
execute Morph.try_classifier(0.6,5); %tests a classifier with a threshold of 0.6 and with 5 iterations

20. Do an extensive analysis by varying threshold
execute Morph.save_ROC_results %generates an ROC curve
execute Morph.view_ROC_results %views an ROC curve

21. Train a classifier for the pipeline
execute Morph.train_classifer %save it at some location

22. Update morph classifier path in Config.get_config
-run init.m  %to update the config values


## RUNNING THE PIPELINE

Create an analysis file.
src/main.m 

## VISUALIZING AN ANALYSIS FILE

Visualize an analysis file
src/GUI/main.m

load the analysis file on prompt.
Click either cell count or cell morphology.

## DEVELOPER NOTES

There are lots of files in the src/ that are not necessary for running the project, but could be useful.
The project is organized into several modules

+Annotation_cell - utility for annotating and holding cell detection ground truth data.

+Annotation_morph - utility forannotating and holding cell morphology classification ground truth

+Config - configuration read/write utility

+ML - for solving the binary classification problem associated with discarding false positive detected cells

+Pipeline - entry point and helper functions for pipeline.

+ROI - White matter segmentation component

+Segment - The meat of the algorithm. The actual cell body and branch segmentation algorithms live here.

+Verify - for comparing our algorithm's performance with the some of the lab's labelled data

assets - holds some misc assets required.

common - for common class definitions, utility functions and other tools

GUI - for visualizing the analyzed microglia data

library - for third party libraries that we source into this project
